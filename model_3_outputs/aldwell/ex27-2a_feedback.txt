PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 94.17%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 2, beat 1, V in G major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['G2', 'D4', 'G4', 'B4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m2 b1 I for the slice ['G2', 'D4', 'G4', 'B4']


Measure 3, beat 3.5, viio6 in C major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 90.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 2, beat 1, V in G major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['G2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 3, beat 3, V65 in C major, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
How about:
m3 b3 V43


Measure 3, beat 3.5, viio6 in C major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
