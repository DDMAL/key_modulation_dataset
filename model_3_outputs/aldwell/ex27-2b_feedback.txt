PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 93.27%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 3, beat 1.5, IV in c minor, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'C4', 'E-4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 3, beat 2.5, iio6 in c minor, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 88.46%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 3, beat 1.5, IV in c minor, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: ['G3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 3, beat 2.5, iio6 in c minor, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 3, beat 3.5, V6 in c minor, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: ['G3'].
How about:
m3 b3.5 V
