PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 95.83%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 3, beat 1.5, ii in c minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 95.83%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 3, beat 1.5, ii in c minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
