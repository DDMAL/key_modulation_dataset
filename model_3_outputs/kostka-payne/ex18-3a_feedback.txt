PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 25.0%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, V in G major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'G4', 'B4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 I for the slice ['G3', 'G4', 'B4', 'D5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, I in G major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 2, V65/V in G major, indicating the pitches ['C#', 'E', 'G', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#3', 'D4', 'A4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b2 V65 for the slice ['F#3', 'D4', 'A4', 'C5']

Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m2 b1 I for the slice ['F3', 'C4', 'F4', 'A4']
