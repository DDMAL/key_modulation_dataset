PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 98.0%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 2, beat 1.5, V7 in C major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 84.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 2, beat 1, I in C major, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['F4'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 2, beat 1.5, V7 in C major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 3, beat 2, V65 in C major, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: ['D4'].
How about:
m3 b2 V43
