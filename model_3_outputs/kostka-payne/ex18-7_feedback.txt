PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 98.44%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 0, beat 2.5, ii in E- major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['F5'], ['G5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 96.88%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 7, beat 1.5, V in E- major, indicating the bass B- for lowest note(s) of: ['D2'].
How about:
m7 b1.5 V6
