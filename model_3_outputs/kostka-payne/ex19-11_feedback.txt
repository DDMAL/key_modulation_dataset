PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 93.75%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 2, beat 2.5, I in g minor, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['B-3', 'D4', 'F4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m2 b2.5 III for the slice ['B-3', 'D4', 'F4', 'D5']


Measure 2, beat 2.75, V in g minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['A3', 'C4', 'F4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m2 b2.75 v43 for the slice ['A3', 'C4', 'F4', 'D5']


Measure 3, beat 1.5, I in g minor, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['E-3', 'B-3', 'F4', 'F5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
