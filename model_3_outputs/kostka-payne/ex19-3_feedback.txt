PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 97.32%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 2, beat 2.5, V7 in C major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['C2', 'G2', 'D3', 'F#3'], ['C2', 'G2', 'D3', 'F#3']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 6, beat 1.5, IV in B- major, indicating the pitches ['E-', 'G', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [['B-1', 'F2', 'B-2', 'D3']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m6 b1.5 I for the slice ['B-1', 'F2', 'B-2', 'D3']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 3, V in C major appears on beat 1.25.
Measure 3, I in C major appears on beat 1.75.
Measure 6, IV in F major appears on beat 1.75.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 85.71%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 2, beat 2.5, V7 in C major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['C2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 3, beat 1, V43 in C major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['C2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 3, beat 1.25, V in C major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['C2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.

Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.

How about:
m6 b1.5 IV64
