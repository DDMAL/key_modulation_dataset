PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 83.31%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in D major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'C4', 'G4', 'E5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 bVII for the slice ['C3', 'C4', 'G4', 'E5']


Measure 1, beat 3, V64 in D major, indicating the pitches ['E', 'A', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A3', 'F#4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 33.0%.
How about:
m0 b3 I64 for the slice ['A3', 'F#4', 'D5']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V in D major appears on beat 3.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 81.25%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 1, I in D major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 3, V64 in D major, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['A3'].
How about:
m1 b3 V
