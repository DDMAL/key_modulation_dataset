PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 70.31%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 2.5, iv in C# major, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'A3', 'F4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m0 b2.5 bii for the slice ['D3', 'A3', 'F4', 'D5']


Measure 1, beat 3.5, I in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B#', 'D#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 4, V in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['D#', 'F##', 'A#'] accounting for successive slices of [['C#3', 'E3', 'C#4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b4 bII6 for the slice ['C#3', 'E3', 'C#4', 'A4']


Measure 2, beat 2.5, V/II in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['E#', 'G##', 'B#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, iv in C# major appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 1, I in g# minor appears on beat 3.5.
Measure 2, V/II in g# minor appears on beat 2.5.

Bass note match: 68.75%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
