PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 65.62%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, i in E major, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['A#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 #iv for the slice ['A#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, I in E major, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [].
