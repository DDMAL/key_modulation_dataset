PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 43.75%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 4.5, V6 in B major, indicating the pitches ['A#', 'C#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 1, V7 in B major, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A#', 'C#', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['B#3', 'E#4', 'G##4'], ['B#3', 'D##4', 'F##4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 #IV64 for the slice ['B#3', 'E#4', 'G##4']
m1 b2 #I for the slice ['B#3', 'D##4', 'F##4']


Measure 2, beat 2.5, V7 in F major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E', 'G', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 3, V7 in B major, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A#', 'C#', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['E#3', 'B#3', 'E#4', 'G##4']].
