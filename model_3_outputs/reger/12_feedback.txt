PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 43.75%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 3.5, V in B major, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A#', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 4, V6 in C# major, indicating the pitches ['B#', 'D#', 'G#'] accounting for successive slices of [['E#3', 'E#4', 'G#4', 'C#5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b4 I6 for the slice ['E#3', 'E#4', 'G#4', 'C#5']


Measure 2, beat 1, V in c# minor, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B#', 'D#'] accounting for successive slices of [['F##3', 'D##4', 'F##4', 'B#4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m2 b1 VII64 for the slice ['F##3', 'D##4', 'F##4', 'B#4']


Measure 2, beat 2, V7/IV in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B#', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['F##3', 'C##4', 'F##4', 'A##4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m2 b2 VII for the slice ['F##3', 'C##4', 'F##4', 'A##4']


Measure 2, beat 2.5, V/IV in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B#', 'D#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 3, V in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['D#', 'F##', 'A#'] accounting for successive slices of [['B#2', 'D##4', 'F##4', 'B#4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m2 b3 #III for the slice ['B#2', 'D##4', 'F##4', 'B#4']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================
