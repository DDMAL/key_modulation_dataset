PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 81.25%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, V in E- major, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 VI for the slice ['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, I in E- major, indicating the pitches ['E-', 'G', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 3, V64 in E- major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'B-', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['B-2', 'B-3', 'G4', 'E-5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 I64 for the slice ['B-2', 'B-3', 'G4', 'E-5']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, I in E- major appears on beat 1.5.

Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
