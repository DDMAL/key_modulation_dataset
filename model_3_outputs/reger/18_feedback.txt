PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 81.25%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, V in C- major, indicating the pitches ['G-', 'B-', 'D-'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 #I for the slice ['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, V in C major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 2.5, I6 in G- major, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D-', 'G-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V in C major appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 1, I6 in G- major appears on beat 2.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 68.75%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):

Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.

Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
