PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 37.5%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, V in C- major, indicating the pitches ['G-', 'B-', 'D-'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 #I for the slice ['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, V in C major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 4.5, IV in C- major, indicating the pitches ['F-', 'A-', 'C-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 1.5, iv in C- major, indicating the pitches ['F-', 'A--', 'C-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
