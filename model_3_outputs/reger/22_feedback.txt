PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 84.38%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1.5, I in a minor, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C#', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 2, ii in a minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'F3', 'D4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m1 b2 iv for the slice ['D3', 'F3', 'D4', 'A4']


Measure 1, beat 2.5, iv in a minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
