PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 78.12%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, IV in b minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'E4', 'G4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 bII for the slice ['C3', 'E4', 'G4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 2, IV6 in b minor, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['E3', 'E4', 'G4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m1 b2 bII6 for the slice ['E3', 'E4', 'G4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 3.5, i in b minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, i in b minor appears on beat 3.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 68.75%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 1, IV in b minor, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 2, IV6 in b minor, indicating the bass G# for lowest note(s) of: ['E3'].
How about:
m1 b2 IV


Measure 1, beat 3.5, i in b minor, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
