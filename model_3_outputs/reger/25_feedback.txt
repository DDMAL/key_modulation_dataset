PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 75.0%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, IV in f# minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'E4', 'G4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 bV for the slice ['C3', 'E4', 'G4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, I in f# minor, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A#', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 2, V6 in f# minor, indicating the pitches ['E#', 'G#', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [['B2', 'D4', 'G4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b2 bII6 for the slice ['B2', 'D4', 'G4', 'D5']


Measure 1, beat 2.5, I6 in f# minor, indicating the pitches ['A#', 'C#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['B2', 'D4', 'G4', 'B4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b2.5 bII6 for the slice ['B2', 'D4', 'G4', 'B4']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, I in f# minor appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 1, I6 in f# minor appears on beat 2.5.

Bass note match: 75.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
