PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 50.0%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 2, beat 1, vo7 in D major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'E-', 'G-'] accounting for successive slices of [['C#2', 'E4', 'G4', 'C#5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m2 b1 viio for the slice ['C#2', 'E4', 'G4', 'C#5']


Measure 2, beat 1.5, viio7 in D major, indicating the pitches ['C#', 'E', 'G', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 2.5, vo7 in G major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A-', 'C-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 4, viio7 in C major, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
