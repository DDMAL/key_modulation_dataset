PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 71.88%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in e minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 bVI for the slice ['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 2, i in C major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E-', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'F3', 'D4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b2 ii for the slice ['D3', 'F3', 'D4', 'A4']


Measure 1, beat 3, V6 in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['F##', 'A#', 'D#'] accounting for successive slices of [['C#3', 'A3', 'E4', 'C#5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 bII6 for the slice ['C#3', 'A3', 'E4', 'C#5']
