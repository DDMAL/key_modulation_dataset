PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 76.56%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in e minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 bVI for the slice ['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 3, V6 in E major, indicating the pitches ['D#', 'F#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['G#2', 'B3', 'E4', 'B4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 I6 for the slice ['G#2', 'B3', 'E4', 'B4']


Measure 1, beat 3.5, V6 in e minor, indicating the pitches ['D#', 'F#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['G#2', 'B3', 'E4', 'G#4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b3.5 I6 for the slice ['G#2', 'B3', 'E4', 'G#4']


Measure 1, beat 4.5, V7 in E- major, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D', 'F', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V6 in e minor appears on beat 3.5.
Measure 1, V7 in E- major appears on beat 4.5.

Bass note match: 68.75%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
