PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 64.06%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in e minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 bVI for the slice ['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 2, vi in e minor, indicating the pitches ['C#', 'E', 'G#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A2', 'A3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b2 iv for the slice ['A2', 'A3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 2.5, iv in e minor, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 1, v6 in a# minor, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B#', 'E#'] accounting for successive slices of [['E#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m2 b1 i64 for the slice ['E#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']


Measure 2, beat 1.5, i in a# minor, indicating the pitches ['A#', 'C#', 'E#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 2.5, V7 in a# minor, indicating the pitches ['E#', 'G##', 'B#', 'D#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, iv in e minor appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 2, i in a# minor appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 2, V7 in a# minor appears on beat 2.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 56.25%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):

How about:
m2 b1 v


Measure 2, beat 1.5, i in a# minor, indicating the bass A# for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 2, beat 2.5, V7 in a# minor, indicating the bass E# for lowest note(s) of: [].
