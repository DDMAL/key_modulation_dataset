PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 32.75%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 3, V in C major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['C#3', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'G#4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 #I for the slice ['C#3', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'G#4']


Measure 1, beat 3.5, V in C# major, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B#', 'D#'] accounting for successive slices of [['E#2', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'G#4'], ['F##2', 'C##3', 'A##3', 'F##4']].
Match strength estimated at 8.0%.
How about:
m1 b3.5 I6 for the slice ['E#2', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'G#4']
m1 b4 #IV for the slice ['F##2', 'C##3', 'A##3', 'F##4']


Measure 2, beat 1.5, viio7 in C# major, indicating the pitches ['B#', 'D#', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 4.5, V7 in C# major, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B#', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
