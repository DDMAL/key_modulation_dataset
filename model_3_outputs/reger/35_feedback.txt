PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 93.75%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 4.5, V in f minor, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V7 in f minor appears on beat 3.5.
Measure 1, V in f minor appears on beat 4.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 87.5%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 3, V65 in f minor, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['B-2'].
How about:
m1 b3 V6#42


Measure 1, beat 4.5, V in f minor, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
