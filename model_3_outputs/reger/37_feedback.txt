PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 53.12%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in E- major, indicating the pitches ['E-', 'G', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [[]].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 1.5, V in E- major, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b2 VI for the slice ['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 2.5, V in f minor, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.

Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 i for the slice ['F3', 'A-3', 'F4', 'C5']

How about:
m1 b4.5 IV75#3 for the slice ['B-2', 'A-3', 'F4', 'D5']
