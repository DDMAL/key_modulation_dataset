PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 73.44%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in a- minor, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [[], ['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b2 #III for the slice ['C3', 'G3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 2.5, I in C major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 3.5, IV6 in a- minor, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'D-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, I in C major appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 1, IV6 in a- minor appears on beat 3.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 68.75%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 1, I in a- minor, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
How about:
m1 b1 I6


Measure 1, beat 2.5, I in C major, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 3.5, IV6 in a- minor, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
