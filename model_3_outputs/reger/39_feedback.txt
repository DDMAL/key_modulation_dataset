PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 45.31%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 4, V7 in A- major, indicating the pitches ['E-', 'G', 'B-', 'D-'] accounting for successive slices of [['A-3', 'E-4', 'G-4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b4 Ib753 for the slice ['A-3', 'E-4', 'G-4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 4.5, V7/IV in A- major, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C', 'E-', 'G-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 1.5, iv in A- major, indicating the pitches ['D-', 'F-', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V7/IV in A- major appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 2, iv in A- major appears on beat 1.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 43.75%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 4, V7 in A- major, indicating the bass E- for lowest note(s) of: ['A-3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 4.5, V7/IV in A- major, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 2, beat 1.5, iv in A- major, indicating the bass D- for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
