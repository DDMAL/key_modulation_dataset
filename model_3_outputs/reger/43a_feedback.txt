PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 73.44%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in D- major, indicating the pitches ['D-', 'F', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [['C#3', 'G#3', 'E#4', 'C#5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 #VII for the slice ['C#3', 'G#3', 'E#4', 'C#5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, V in D- major, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 2.5, V in G major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'B3', 'G4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b2.5 I for the slice ['G3', 'B3', 'G4', 'D5']


Measure 1, beat 3, i in A- major, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C-', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'C4', 'G4', 'E-5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 iii for the slice ['C3', 'C4', 'G4', 'E-5']
