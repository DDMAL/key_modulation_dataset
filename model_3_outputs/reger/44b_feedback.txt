PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 43.75%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, V in D- major, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [['C#3', 'G#3', 'E#4', 'C#5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 #VII for the slice ['C#3', 'G#3', 'E#4', 'C#5']


Measure 2, beat 1.5, IV6 in A- major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'D-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 4, iv6 in A- major, indicating the pitches ['F-', 'A-', 'D-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 4.5, iv in A- major, indicating the pitches ['D-', 'F-', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
