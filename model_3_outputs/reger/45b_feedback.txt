PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 7.81%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, V in G- major, indicating the pitches ['D-', 'F', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [['C#3', 'C#4', 'G#4', 'E#5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 ##IV for the slice ['C#3', 'C#4', 'G#4', 'E#5']


Measure 1, beat 2, I in G major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#3', 'C#4', 'A4', 'F#5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b2 vii for the slice ['F#3', 'C#4', 'A4', 'F#5']


Measure 1, beat 3, IV in f# minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'B3', 'G4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 bII for the slice ['G3', 'B3', 'G4', 'D5']


Measure 1, beat 3.5, IV in G major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [].

Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.

How about:
m2 b3 bbii for the slice ['G-3', 'D-4', 'G-4', 'B--4']


Measure 2, beat 4, i in f# minor, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
