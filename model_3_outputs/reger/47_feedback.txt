PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 81.25%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1.5, ii in e minor, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#2', 'C4', 'E4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m1 b2 ii/o7 for the slice ['F#2', 'C4', 'E4', 'A4']


Measure 1, beat 2.5, ii6 in e minor, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 3.5, i in e minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, ii in e minor appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 1, ii6 in e minor appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 1, i in e minor appears on beat 3.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 87.5%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 2.5, ii6 in e minor, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 3.5, i in e minor, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
