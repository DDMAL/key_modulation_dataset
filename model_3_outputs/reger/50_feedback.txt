PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 81.25%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 2.5, V65 in a minor, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B', 'D', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 3, ii in f# minor, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B', 'D#'] accounting for successive slices of [['F#2', 'C#4', 'F#4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 i for the slice ['F#2', 'C#4', 'F#4', 'A4']


Measure 1, beat 3.5, i in f# minor, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V65 in a minor appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 1, i in f# minor appears on beat 3.5.
Measure 1, V7 in c# minor appears on beat 4.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 75.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 2, V65 in A major, indicating the bass G# for lowest note(s) of: ['B2'].
How about:
m1 b2 V43


Measure 1, beat 2.5, V65 in a minor, indicating the bass G# for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 3, ii in f# minor, indicating the bass G# for lowest note(s) of: ['F#2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 3.5, i in f# minor, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
