PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 70.31%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, i in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B', 'D#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A2', 'E4', 'A4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 bii for the slice ['A2', 'E4', 'A4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, i in a minor, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 3.5, V in F# major, indicating the pitches ['C#', 'E#', 'G#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 4, V65/V in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['C##', 'E#', 'G#', 'A#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A#2', 'C#4', 'F##4', 'D#5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m0 b4 V#643 for the slice ['A#2', 'C#4', 'F##4', 'D#5']


Measure 1, beat 4.5, V7/V in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['A#', 'C##', 'E#', 'G#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
