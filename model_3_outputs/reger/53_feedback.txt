PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 17.19%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, iv in a minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['A2', 'A3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 i for the slice ['A2', 'A3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 2, V in E major, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['E3', 'G#3', 'E4', 'B4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m0 b2 I for the slice ['E3', 'G#3', 'E4', 'B4']


Measure 1, beat 3.5, V6 in e minor, indicating the pitches ['D#', 'F#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 4, v6 in e minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['E#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b4 #iv64 for the slice ['E#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']


Measure 1, beat 4.5, V7 in e minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['E#3', 'B#3', 'E#4', 'G##4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b4.5 #I for the slice ['E#3', 'B#3', 'E#4', 'G##4']


Measure 2, beat 1, V in a# minor, indicating the pitches ['E#', 'G##', 'B#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A#2', 'A#3', 'E#4', 'A#4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 1.5, i in a# minor, indicating the pitches ['A#', 'C#', 'E#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V6 in e minor appears on beat 3.5.
Measure 1, V7 in e minor appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 2, i in a# minor appears on beat 1.5.

Bass note match: 6.25%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
