PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 89.06%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 3, vii6 in d minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G#', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'D4', 'E4', 'B-4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m0 b3 ii/o65 for the slice ['G3', 'D4', 'E4', 'B-4']


Measure 1, beat 3.5, viio6 in d minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [].

Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
