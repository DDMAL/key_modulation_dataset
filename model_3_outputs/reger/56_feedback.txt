PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 87.5%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1.5, ii in G major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, ii in G major appears on beat 1.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 62.5%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 1.5, ii in G major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 2, viio in G major, indicating the bass F# for lowest note(s) of: ['A2'].
How about:
m1 b2 viio6
