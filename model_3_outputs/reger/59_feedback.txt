PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 78.12%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 2.5, ii in F major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B-', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 4, V in F major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [['F3', 'C4', 'F4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m0 b4 I for the slice ['F3', 'C4', 'F4', 'A4']


Measure 1, beat 4.5, V7/IV in b- minor, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D', 'F', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [['F3', 'C4', 'E-4', 'A4']].

How about:

Measure 2, beat 4.5, iv in b- minor, indicating the pitches ['E-', 'G-', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
