PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 65.62%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, vi in E- major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E-', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [['A3', 'C4', 'E4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 #iv for the slice ['A3', 'C4', 'E4', 'A4']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, ii in a minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 2.5, V6 in A- major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B-', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, ii in a minor appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 1, V6 in A- major appears on beat 2.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 62.5%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 1, vi in E- major, indicating the bass C for lowest note(s) of: ['A3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.

Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 2.5, V6 in A- major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: [].
