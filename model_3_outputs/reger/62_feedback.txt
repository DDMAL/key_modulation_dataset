PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 46.88%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 2, V6 in A- major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B-', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'D4', 'F4', 'B-4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m0 b2 II6 for the slice ['D3', 'D4', 'F4', 'B-4']


Measure 2, beat 1.5, iv in A- major, indicating the pitches ['D-', 'F-', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V7/IV in A- major appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 2, iv in A- major appears on beat 1.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 43.75%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 2, V6 in A- major, indicating the bass G for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 2, beat 1.5, iv in A- major, indicating the bass D- for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
