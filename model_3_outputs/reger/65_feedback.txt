PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 56.25%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 2, I6 in a# minor, indicating the pitches ['C##', 'E#', 'A#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A3', 'C4', 'F4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b2 bbVI6 for the slice ['A3', 'C4', 'F4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 2.5, V6 in a# minor, indicating the pitches ['G##', 'B#', 'E#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
