PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 87.5%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, iv in a minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['A3', 'C4', 'E4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 i for the slice ['A3', 'C4', 'E4', 'A4']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 75.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 1, iv in a minor, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['A3'].
How about:
m1 b1 iv64
