PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 90.62%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 3, I in e minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['B2', 'B3', 'D#4', 'F#4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m0 b3 V for the slice ['B2', 'B3', 'D#4', 'F#4']


Measure 1, beat 3.5, I in B major, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, I in B major appears on beat 3.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 87.5%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 3, I in e minor, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: ['B2'].
How about:
m1 b3 I64


Measure 1, beat 3.5, I in B major, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
