PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 29.69%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, iv in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['C#', 'E', 'G#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A3', 'C4', 'E4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 bii for the slice ['A3', 'C4', 'E4', 'A4']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, i in a minor, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.

How about:
m0 b2.5 I6 for the slice ['G#3', 'B3', 'E4', 'G#4']


Measure 1, beat 3, V in E major, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A#3', 'C##4', 'E#4']].
