PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 37.5%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 4, V in e minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['E#3', 'B#3', 'G##4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b4 #I for the slice ['E#3', 'B#3', 'G##4']


Measure 2, beat 1, V7 in e minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['A#2', 'E#3', 'C##4', 'A#4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 #IV for the slice ['A#2', 'E#3', 'C##4', 'A#4']


Measure 2, beat 3.5, V7 in b minor, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A#', 'C#', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 4, V in b minor, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A#', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.

Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
