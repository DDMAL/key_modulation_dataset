PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 28.12%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, iv in a minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['A2', 'A3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 i for the slice ['A2', 'A3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, i in a minor, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 4, V in E major, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['E#3', 'B#3', 'G##4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b4 #I for the slice ['E#3', 'B#3', 'G##4']


Measure 1, beat 4.5, V in e minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].

How about:
m1 b1 #V for the slice ['B#2', 'D##3', 'B#3', 'F##4']


Measure 2, beat 2.5, V7 in e minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['E#2', 'E#3', 'B#3', 'G##4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 #I for the slice ['E#2', 'E#3', 'B#3', 'G##4']


Measure 2, beat 3.5, V in e minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================
