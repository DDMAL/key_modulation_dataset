PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 75.0%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, iv in E- major, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C-', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [['A2', 'E4', 'A4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 #iv for the slice ['A2', 'E4', 'A4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, ii in E- major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, ii in E- major appears on beat 1.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 75.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 1, iv in E- major, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['A2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 1.5, ii in E- major, indicating the bass F for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
