PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 58.31%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, i in E major, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['A3', 'E4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 33.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 iv for the slice ['A3', 'E4', 'C5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, i in C- major, indicating the pitches ['C-', 'E--', 'G-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
