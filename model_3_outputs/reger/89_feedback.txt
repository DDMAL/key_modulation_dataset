PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 77.06%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in C# major, indicating the pitches ['C#', 'E#', 'G#'] accounting for successive slices of [['D-3', 'F3', 'D-4', 'A-4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 bbII for the slice ['D-3', 'F3', 'D-4', 'A-4']
