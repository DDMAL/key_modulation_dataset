PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 47.88%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 2.5, V in f# minor, indicating the pitches ['C#', 'E#', 'G#'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'E-3', 'C4', 'A-4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b2.5 bIII6 for the slice ['C3', 'E-3', 'C4', 'A-4']


Measure 1, beat 3, I in A major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C#', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'A3', 'F#4']].
Match strength estimated at 33.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 IV for the slice ['D3', 'A3', 'F#4']


Measure 1, beat 3.5, V7 in D major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C#', 'E', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [['C#3', 'E3', 'A#3', 'F#4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m1 b3.5 III#643 for the slice ['C#3', 'E3', 'A#3', 'F#4']


Measure 1, beat 4, i in A major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['B2', 'D3', 'B3', 'F#4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b4 ii for the slice ['B2', 'D3', 'B3', 'F#4']


Measure 1, beat 4.5, i in b minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V in f# minor appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 1, V7 in D major appears on beat 3.5.
Measure 1, i in b minor appears on beat 4.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 37.5%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 2.5, V in f# minor, indicating the bass C# for lowest note(s) of: ['C3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 3, I in A major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['D3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 3.5, V7 in D major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['C#3'].
How about:
m1 b3.5 V65


Measure 1, beat 4, i in A major, indicating the bass A for lowest note(s) of: ['B2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 4.5, i in b minor, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
