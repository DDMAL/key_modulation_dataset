PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 63.12%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, IV6 in C# major, indicating the pitches ['A#', 'C#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['D-4', 'F-4', 'A-4', 'D-5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 bbii for the slice ['D-4', 'F-4', 'A-4', 'D-5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, IV in A- major, indicating the pitches ['D-', 'F', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 3, V in D major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C#', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['D4', 'F#4', 'A4'], ['D3', 'D4', 'F#4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 30.0%.
How about:
m0 b3 I for the slice ['D4', 'F#4', 'A4']

Measure 2, beat 2.5, V7 in g# minor, indicating the pitches ['D#', 'F##', 'A#', 'C#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
