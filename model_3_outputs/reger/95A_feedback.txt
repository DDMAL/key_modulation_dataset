PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 62.5%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, i in B major, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 vii for the slice ['A#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, I in B major, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 4, I6 in B- major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [['A2', 'C4', 'F4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m0 b4 V6 for the slice ['A2', 'C4', 'F4', 'A4']


Measure 2, beat 1, I6 in B- major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [['A2', 'C4', 'F4', 'C5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 V6 for the slice ['A2', 'C4', 'F4', 'C5']


Measure 2, beat 2.5, V7 in B- major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
