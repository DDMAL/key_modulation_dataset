PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 79.69%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, vi in e minor, indicating the pitches ['C#', 'E', 'G#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 #iv for the slice ['A#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, i in e minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 2.5, I6 in E major, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['D#3', 'B3', 'F#4', 'B4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m0 b2.5 V6 for the slice ['D#3', 'B3', 'F#4', 'B4']


Measure 2, beat 1.5, V6 in F major, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, i in e minor appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 1, I6 in E major appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 2, V6 in F major appears on beat 1.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 75.0%.
