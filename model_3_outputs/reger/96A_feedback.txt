I rate the pitch coverage at about 71.88%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, i in B major, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A#2', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'C#5']].

How about:
m0 b1 vii for the slice ['A#2', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'C#5']
