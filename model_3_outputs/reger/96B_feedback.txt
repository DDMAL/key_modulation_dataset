PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 64.06%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, i in B major, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A#2', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'C#5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 vii for the slice ['A#2', 'E#3', 'C#4', 'C#5']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, I in B major, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 3, i in B- major, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D-', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['E-3', 'B-3', 'G-4', 'E-5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 iv for the slice ['E-3', 'B-3', 'G-4', 'E-5']


Measure 2, beat 3.5, i in e- minor, indicating the pitches ['E-', 'G-', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
