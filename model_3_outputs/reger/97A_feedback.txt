PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 71.81%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, i in d# minor, indicating the pitches ['D#', 'F#', 'A#'] accounting for successive slices of [['A#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 v for the slice ['A#3', 'C#4', 'E#4', 'A#4']


Measure 1, beat 1.5, i in E major, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 2, I6 in E major, indicating the pitches ['G#', 'B', 'E'] accounting for successive slices of [['D#3', 'D#4', 'F#4', 'B4'], ['D#3', 'B3', 'F#4', 'B4']].
Match strength estimated at 37.0%.
How about:
m0 b2 V6 for the slice ['D#3', 'D#4', 'F#4', 'B4']
m0 b2.5 V6 for the slice ['D#3', 'B3', 'F#4', 'B4']


Measure 1, beat 4, I6 in B- major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [['A2', 'C4', 'F4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m0 b4 V6 for the slice ['A2', 'C4', 'F4', 'A4']


Measure 2, beat 1.5, V in A major, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, i in E major appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 1, V6 in B- major appears on beat 4.5.
Measure 2, V in A major appears on beat 1.5.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 62.5%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 1, i in d# minor, indicating the bass D# for lowest note(s) of: ['A#3'].
How about:
m1 b1 i64


Measure 1, beat 1.5, i in E major, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 2, I6 in E major, indicating the bass G# for lowest note(s) of: ['D#3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 1, beat 4, I6 in B- major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['A2'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 2, beat 1.5, V in A major, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
