PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 81.25%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 3.5, V42 in a minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'E', 'G#', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.

The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
