PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 75.0%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, V in E- major, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [['C4', 'C5', 'E5', 'G5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 VI for the slice ['C4', 'C5', 'E5', 'G5']



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 75.0%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 1, V in E- major, indicating the bass B- for lowest note(s) of: ['C4'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
