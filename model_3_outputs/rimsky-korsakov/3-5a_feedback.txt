PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 87.5%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in F major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['C4', 'G4', 'C5', 'E5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m0 b1 V for the slice ['C4', 'G4', 'C5', 'E5']


Measure 1, beat 2, V in F major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 3, beat 2.5, I in F major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
