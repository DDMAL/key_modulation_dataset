PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 85.94%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 2, beat 1, I in f minor, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['D-4', 'F4', 'A-4', 'F5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 bVI for the slice ['D-4', 'F4', 'A-4', 'F5']


Measure 2, beat 1.5, VI in f minor, indicating the pitches ['D-', 'F', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 3, beat 2.5, i in f minor, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A-', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V7 in f minor appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 2, VI in f minor appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 3, i in f minor appears on beat 2.5.

Bass note match: 84.38%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
