PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 62.5%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 3.5, V42 in F major, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'C', 'E', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 3, beat 1, v in F major, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E-', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [['A3', 'C4', 'E4', 'A4']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m2 b1 iii for the slice ['A3', 'C4', 'E4', 'A4']


Measure 3, beat 3.5, vi in d minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 3, beat 4, i in d minor, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
