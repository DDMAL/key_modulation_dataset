PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 81.25%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1.5, i in e minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.

The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 1.5, i in e minor, indicating the bass E for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
