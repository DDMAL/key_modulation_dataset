PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 51.56%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 3, V in G major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'G4', 'B4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m0 b3 I for the slice ['G3', 'G4', 'B4', 'D5']


Measure 1, beat 3.5, V in C major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 1, viio65 in C major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A-', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['E4', 'G4', 'C#5', 'E5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 #io6 for the slice ['E4', 'G4', 'C#5', 'E5']


Measure 2, beat 2.5, VII65 in d minor, indicating the pitches ['E', 'G', 'B-', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
