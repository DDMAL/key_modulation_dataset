PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 75.0%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 2, beat 1, viio65 in C major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F', 'A-', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [['E4', 'G4', 'C#5', 'E5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 #io6 for the slice ['E4', 'G4', 'C#5', 'E5']


Measure 2, beat 2.5, VII65 in C major, indicating the pitches ['D#', 'F#', 'A', 'B'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
