PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 37.5%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in f minor, indicating the pitches ['F', 'A', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'G4', 'C5', 'E5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 V for the slice ['C3', 'G4', 'C5', 'E5']


Measure 1, beat 2, V in f minor, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 2.5, V in D- major, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 1.5, I in A- major, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 2.5, I in D- major, indicating the pitches ['D-', 'F', 'A-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 4, I in A- major, indicating the pitches ['A-', 'C', 'E-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 1, V in D- major appears on beat 2.5.
Measure 2, I in A- major appears on beat 1.5.
Measure 2, I in D- major appears on beat 2.5.

Bass note match: 31.25%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
