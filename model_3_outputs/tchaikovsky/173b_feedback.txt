PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 73.44%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in G major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'C4', 'G4', 'E5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 IV for the slice ['C3', 'C4', 'G4', 'E5']


Measure 1, beat 2.5, I in D major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.
