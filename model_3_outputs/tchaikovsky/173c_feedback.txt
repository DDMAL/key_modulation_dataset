PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 87.5%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 4, V in E- major, indicating the pitches ['B-', 'D', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 62.5%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 1, beat 4, V in E- major, indicating the bass B- for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 2, beat 1, V42 in E- major, indicating the bass A- for lowest note(s) of: ['F3'].
How about:
m2 b1 V43
