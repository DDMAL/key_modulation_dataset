PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 85.79%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 2, beat 4, V42 in C major, indicating the pitches ['F', 'G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'F#4', 'A4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m2 b4 II6#42 for the slice ['C3', 'F#4', 'A4', 'D5']


Measure 3, beat 1, i6 in c minor, indicating the pitches ['E-', 'G', 'C'] accounting for successive slices of [['B-2', 'G4', 'D5'], ['B-2', 'G4', 'D5', 'G5']].
Match strength estimated at 42.0%.
How about:
m3 b1 v6 for the slice ['B-2', 'G4', 'D5']
m3 b2 v6 for the slice ['B-2', 'G4', 'D5', 'G5']


Measure 3, beat 3.5, V65 in c minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'F', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 4, beat 1, i in c minor, indicating the pitches ['C', 'E-', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'G4', 'B-4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m4 b1 v for the slice ['G3', 'G4', 'B-4', 'D5']


Measure 5, beat 2.5, iv6 in f minor, indicating the pitches ['D-', 'F', 'B-'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 75.0%.
