PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 81.25%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 2, beat 3, ii in f minor, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B-', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['B-2', 'F4', 'B-4', 'D-5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m2 b3 iv for the slice ['B-2', 'F4', 'B-4', 'D-5']
