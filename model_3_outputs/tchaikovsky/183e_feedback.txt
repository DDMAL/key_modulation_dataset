PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 74.47%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 4, V6 in G major, indicating the pitches ['F#', 'A', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['B2', 'D4', 'G4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m1 b4 I6 for the slice ['B2', 'D4', 'G4', 'D5']


Measure 1, beat 4.5, I6 in G major, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'G'] accounting for successive slices of [].

How about:
m2 b1 #iiob7b53 for the slice ['A#2', 'E4', 'G4', 'C#5']
