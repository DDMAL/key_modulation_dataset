PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 24.75%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 1, I in G major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['C3', 'G4', 'C5', 'E5'], ['E3', 'G4', 'C5', 'E5']].
Match strength estimated at 24.0%.
How about:
m1 b1 IV for the slice ['C3', 'G4', 'C5', 'E5']
m1 b2 IV6 for the slice ['E3', 'G4', 'C5', 'E5']


Measure 1, beat 3, V in G major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'G4', 'B4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m1 b3 I for the slice ['G3', 'G4', 'B4', 'D5']


Measure 2, beat 1, I in G major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [['D3', 'F#4', 'A4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 50.0%.
How about:
m2 b1 V for the slice ['D3', 'F#4', 'A4', 'D5']


Measure 2, beat 1.5, I in D major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 2, beat 4, I in G major, indicating the pitches ['G', 'B', 'D'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

In the following cases, the chord change is at an unusually weak metrical position:
Measure 2, I in D major appears on beat 1.5.

How about:
m2 b1 I64


Measure 2, beat 1.5, I in D major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
