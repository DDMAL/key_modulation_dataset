PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 75.0%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 1, beat 2.5, IV6 in C major, indicating the pitches ['A', 'C', 'F'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 3.5, I in b minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.


Measure 1, beat 4, viio43/V in b minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D', 'E#', 'G#'] accounting for successive slices of [['E3', 'G4', 'A#4', 'C#5']].
Match strength estimated at 0.0%.
How about:
m1 b4 viio6#43 for the slice ['E3', 'G4', 'A#4', 'C#5']
