PITCH COVERAGE =====================

I rate the pitch coverage at about 90.28%. In the following cases, the chord indicated does not seem to capture everything going on:

Measure 2, beat 1, V in G major, indicating the pitches ['D', 'F#', 'A'] accounting for successive slices of [['G3', 'G4', 'B4', 'D5']].
Match strength estimated at 25.0%.
How about:
m2 b1 I for the slice ['G3', 'G4', 'B4', 'D5']


Measure 2, beat 1.5, V in e minor, indicating the pitches ['B', 'D#', 'F#'] accounting for successive slices of [].
Match strength estimated at 0%.
Sorry, no suggestions - I can't find any triads or sevenths.



HARMONIC RHYTHM =====================

The harmonic rhythm looks good: all the chord changes take place on strong metrical positions.



BASS / INVERSION =====================

Bass note match: 88.89%.
The following chords look ok, except for the bass note / inversion. (NB: pedal points are not currently supported):
Measure 2, beat 1, V in G major, indicating the bass D for lowest note(s) of: ['G3'].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.


Measure 2, beat 1.5, V in e minor, indicating the bass B for lowest note(s) of: [].
Sorry, no inversion suggestions - none of the bass note(s) are in the chord.
